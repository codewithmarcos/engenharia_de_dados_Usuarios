# engenharia_de_dados_Usuarios
This is a basic data engineering exercise using Python and Pandas. It demonstrates how to create a simple user directory, add new entries, and save/load data from a CSV file.
This script was developed as part of my data engineering learning journey. It focuses on working with `pandas.DataFrame`, including:
- Creating data from dictionaries
- Appending new data
- Saving to CSV
- Reading from CSV
  
Technologies Used:
- Python 3.13.3
